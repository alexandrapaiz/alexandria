# Unowned duties

Maintained by the ExO agent (charter §3b). Created 2026-09-19 after
incident 19, the Hugging Face incident that no seat captured.

This page exists because of one discovery. Twelve charters each say what
a seat must produce, and not one of them said the org must know what the
world knows. Every seat did its job correctly and the org was blind
anyway. A duty that no charter names is invisible to every audit we run,
because every other audit checks performance against a charter. This is
the only page that checks the charters against reality.

## How to read the table

One row per duty the org's behavior assumes somebody performs. The owner
column says which seat's charter names the duty in words, not which seat
would probably do it if asked. "None" is the finding. A duty split across
three seats with no named owner is also a finding, because shared
custody of awareness is how incident 19 happened.

| Duty | Owner | Evidence | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| The org knows what the world knows | market (§5, named 2026-09-19) | this run | assigned |
| Ecosystem events steer what we ingest | research (signal read) | charter, 2026-09-19 | consuming |
| Upstream compromise is in the threat model | security (incident 19 item 2) | PR #41 | in flight |
| Legal and compliance posture | **none** | see below | owner decision |
| Free-tier and quota headroom | finance, dormant | see below | owner decision |
| The corpus survives losing its database | **none** | see below | owner decision |
| The repo describes the system it is | exo (§5b) | charter | assigned |
| Runs that fail get diagnosed | exo (§2b) | charter, 2026-09-19 | assigned |
| Runs that fail get reported to the owner | pm (§1f) | charter, 2026-09-19 | assigned |

## The three open gaps, with the check each one needs

None of these is being proposed as a charter edit by this run. Each one
either costs money, touches the owner's personal exposure, or activates
a dormant seat, and all three of those are hers to decide. What follows
is the finding, the proposed check, and the seat that could carry it.

### 1. Legal and compliance posture

No charter in `prompts/` contains the words legal, privacy, GDPR,
CAN-SPAM, copyright, or robots.txt. That was verified by grep on
2026-09-19 across all twelve. Meanwhile three things are already true.
The site collects email addresses today and stores them in
`site/lib/waitlist.js`. The pricing page tells a visitor "We send one
email, and it carries an unsubscribe link" at `site/app/pricing/page.jsx`
line 49, while the unsubscribe endpoint is still a Phase-2 build item in
`docs/roadmap.md`. The digest redistributes other people's paper content
under licenses nobody has read in writing. Launch is Oct 13.

Proposed check: one line on the PM's launch-readiness gate that says
legal and compliance readiness is answered in writing before send, with
the content of that answer being the owner's call. This is the smallest
thing that makes the gap visible on a date rather than after it.

Proposed owner: the owner decides the substance, the PM owns the gate
line, because the PM already owns the launch runway.

### 2. Free-tier and quota headroom

The only charter that watches metered usage is the finance seat's, and
the finance seat is dormant. So today nothing in the org would notice
Groq's free tier, Neon's row limits, or GitHub Actions minutes
approaching a ceiling until a job started failing. The org's standing
rule that cost stays at zero is enforced by nobody counting.

Proposed check: until finance is activated, the engineer's daily run
names any quota error or rate-limit response seen in the pipeline logs,
in one line, even when the run otherwise succeeded.

Proposed owner: activate finance monthly, which is a one-line schedule
change, or give the interim line to the engineer. Owner's call.

### 3. The corpus survives losing its database

Nothing in `prompts/`, `docs/`, `pipeline/`, or `.github/workflows/`
mentions a backup, a dump, or a restore. That was verified by grep on
2026-09-19. One Postgres database on a free tier holds the papers, the
claims, the embeddings, the claim graph, and the subscriber list. The
vision calls this a library. A library with no second copy is a rumor.

Proposed check: the security seat's biweekly sweep answers once, in
writing, "if this database were lost tonight, what survives and how long
would rebuilding take." An answer of "nothing, and weeks" is a finding
for the owner rather than a fix for the seat, because a backup target
may cost money.

Proposed owner: security writes the assessment, the owner decides what
to spend on it.

## The rule that keeps this page honest

A duty only leaves this page by being written into a charter in words a
run can act on. Moving a row to "assigned" because it feels covered is
the exact mistake that made incident 19 possible.
