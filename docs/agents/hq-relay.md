# Relay to HQ — what alexandria owes Alexandra Systems upward

**Enforced at:** prompts/exo-agent.md §3e. The ExO seat writes entries.
The chair carries them, because no automated channel exists yet.

Seats never message each other and no seat in this repository can write
to `alexandrapaiz/alexandra-systems`. So evidence that matters to the
parent stops here unless a human moves it. This file is the outbox. Each
entry is written to be copied into an HQ issue or a chair message with
no editing, per the standard the PM's dispatch queue already uses: if
the carrier has to compose anything, the note did not work.

An entry stays until the chair marks it delivered with a date.

## 2026-09-24 — Kimi routing failed alexandria's PM seat twice, and the same class hit HQ's own seats

**Status: undelivered.**

**For:** whoever owns HQ ADR-015.

**The short version.** ADR-015's open routing has now produced four
failed runs across two repositories and zero successful ones. Alexandria
has removed the secrets and fallen back to Sonnet. The rollout also
skipped a safety gate that alexandria's own routing law requires, and
nobody here knew the model had changed until three days later. The
direction is not in question. The rollout shape is.

**The evidence, alexandria side.** Commit 609d7cc, merged 2026-09-19
18:49 UTC, gave `agent-pm.yml`, `agent-market.yml`, `agent-okr.yml` and
`agent-finance.yml` a preferred run step on `kimi-k2.7-code`.

- Run 35493791740, 2026-09-20: `is_error: true` at `num_turns: 1`,
  empty `modelUsage`, `total_cost_usd: 0`. The endpoint did not serve
  the request at all. This is plumbing, not quality.
- Run 35626266985, 2026-09-21: the model answered, worked twelve
  minutes, then `is_error: true` at `num_turns: 30` against a cap of
  300. The no-ship tripwire fired, so the run had made commits it never
  pushed. This one is quality, and specifically it is tool-calling
  reliability on a long agentic run.

Read those two apart. They are different failures and only the second is
evidence about the model.

**The evidence, HQ side, as reported to alexandria's owner.** pm 2/2
failed, finance 1/3, okr 1/2. Same week, same routing, same seats by
role. Two products producing the same failure distribution independently
is a stronger result than either one alone, and neither of us had the
other's numbers until the owner carried them by hand.

**Three things alexandria asks HQ to consider.**

1. **The rollout order is backwards.** ADR-015 routed the PM first in
   both repositories. The PM is the fleet-health seat, it is the seat
   that reports run failures to the owner, and under company ADR-033 it
   is now the only seat with dispatch authority. So the experiment was
   run on the seat whose absence makes every other failure harder to
   see. Route the seat whose failure costs least. In alexandria that is
   finance, which is dormant, or okr, which runs monthly.

2. **The either/or shape turns a routing experiment into a lost run.**
   Both workflows' Claude step is guarded by `if: env.OPENROUTE == ''`,
   so it is unreachable by construction while the key exists. A failed
   open-model attempt should cost three minutes, not the run. The two
   line fix is written out in full in
   `docs/agents/pending-workflow-changes.md` item 1b in this repository,
   and it applies verbatim to HQ's copies. Alexandria's position is that
   the secrets do not come back here until that is applied, because
   re-adding the key today re-arms the identical failure on the identical
   seat.

3. **The gate that was skipped.** `docs/agents/model-routing.md` in this
   repository requires a golden-set comparison before any seat leaves
   its explicit model. It was written on 2026-09-17 and it names the
   exact hazard that then occurred, in these words: "open-model
   tool-calling reliability on long agentic runs." The gate was not
   overruled, it was not seen. Alexandria is not claiming HQ meant to
   drop it.

**The general point, which is the reason this note exists at all.** A
parent decision changed a subsidiary's machinery with no record inside
the subsidiary except a commit subject, and overrode a local safety
clause without either party noticing there was one. That is a mechanism
rather than a mistake, and it will recur on the next ADR unless the
shape changes. Alexandria's proposed rule is in
`docs/agents/cross-repo-law.md` and it is short: parent decisions govern
and they do not take effect silently, which means one entry in the
subsidiary's decisions file, one line in the local law that is being
overridden, and the affected seats told in a file their charters
already read. It is not a veto and it adds no approval step. Alexandria
offers it as a candidate for the standards set, since every product HQ
bootstraps will have the same exposure the moment it writes its first
local law.

**One thing HQ may already have and alexandria does not.** Whether
ADR-015 was accompanied anywhere by a measurement of what open routing
was expected to save. Alexandria's routing register has the lever
analysis but no number. If the saving is large the calculus on retrying
changes, and if it is small the four failed runs already cost more than
the experiment can return.

## 2026-09-27 — An HQ incident number reached alexandria as a commit subject, and its decision was recorded nowhere here

**Status: undelivered.**

**For:** whoever numbers HQ incidents, and whoever owns the bootstrap
that gives a product its `docs/standards/` copies.

**The short version.** HQ Incident 5 changed how alexandria deploys to
production. The change is good and the reasoning behind it is sound. It
arrived here as a commit subject and nine lines of comment inside the
workflow file it added, and nowhere else. `grep -rn "HQ Incident 5"
docs/` in this repository returns nothing. So the subsidiary now runs a
deploy path whose justification lives only in the artifact that
implements it, and the local file that holds the guardrails for scheduled
delivery went on describing the path that had been replaced.

This is the same interface defect as the ADR-015 entry above, in its
cheaper form. That one was a parent decision silently overriding a local
law. This one is a parent decision with no local law to override, and
therefore nothing to catch it.

**The evidence.** Commit `1baeb7f`, pushed straight to main on
2026-09-25 by the owner, subject "Production deploys via a deploy hook on
main; seat branches no longer create Vercel deployments (HQ Incident 5:
the 100/day limit)". It adds `.github/workflows/deploy-main.yml` and
sets `git.deploymentEnabled=false` in `site/vercel.json`. No pull
request explains it (`gh api .../commits/1baeb7f/pulls` is empty) and no
smoke run precedes it. The first execution of the new workflow is a
production push. That half is registered locally as
`INC-2026-09-26-deploy-workflow-no-smoke-run` by the engineer seat.

What the engineer's entry does not cover, and what this note is about, is
that four days later no file a seat reads knew the change existed:
not `docs/decisions.md`, not `docs/agents/runtime-changes.md`, and not
`docs/agents/delivery-health.md`, which is the ExO seat's own file and
whose table still read "The site | deploy on merge". Fixed here on
2026-09-27, four days after the fact, by a weekly audit.

**What alexandria is asking for, and it is small.** An HQ incident number
is a parent record. When one of them changes a subsidiary's runtime, the
subsidiary needs the number to resolve to something inside its own
repository, because that is where its seats look and they cannot read
HQ's register. One line in the product's `docs/decisions.md` naming the
HQ incident and what it changed locally is enough. That is the same
obligation `docs/agents/cross-repo-law.md` already proposes for a parent
ADR, and this week is the evidence that it should cover incidents too,
which alexandria's own rule did not anticipate: §3f of the ExO charter
greps for `ADR-0[0-9]{2}` and HQ markers, and it caught this commit only
because the subject happened to contain the word "HQ".

**The generalizable part, offered for the standards set.** A decision's
reasoning should not live in the artifact that implements it. A comment
at the top of a workflow is read by whoever opens that file for some
other reason, which in a subsidiary run by agents is nobody for days at
a time. The ExO charter's §3f now carries this as a rule for reading
upward. It would do more good in `docs/standards/` as a rule for writing
downward.

**One thing HQ may already know and alexandria does not.** Whether the
100-deployments-a-day ceiling was hit by alexandria's branches alone or
across several products on one Vercel account. If it is shared, then
every product that bootstraps with branch deploys enabled is spending a
quota the others need, and the fix belongs in the bootstrap rather than
in each product's incident register one outage at a time.

## 2026-09-27 — L-X6's missing half: a duty also needs the credential its evidence requires

**Status: undelivered.**

**For:** whoever maintains `docs/standards/lessons.md`, the exo
centralizer.

**The short version.** L-X6 is the cadence test, and it is right: a duty
is owned only when the seat's cadence is shorter than the duty's trigger
rate. Alexandria applied it, closed a real gap with it, and then found a
duty that passes it and is still not being performed. **A duty also needs
the credential its evidence requires, and a charter cannot grant one.**

**The evidence, alexandria side.** `docs/agents/delivery-health.md`
guardrail 4 defines the press's delivery evidence as the newest row in the
`digests` table and assigns the daily watch to the PM seat.
`prompts/pm-agent.md` §1f names it in words a run can act on, and the PM
runs daily, so both the wording and the cadence tests pass.
`.github/workflows/agent-pm.yml` has never carried `NEON_RO_URL`. Three
other workflows in the same repository do.

The result is the failure mode worth the company's attention, because it
is not silence. The seat reports. Every standup since 2026-09-24 says, in
the file, that it could not query the table, and substitutes the public
site's archive page, where a row written and never sent, a send that failed
after the row landed, and a page served from an edge cache all read as
healthy. Those are precisely the three failures the guardrail exists to
catch, so the proxy is weakest exactly where the real check is worth most.
Three consecutive weekly audits scored the row `assigned`.

**The proposed lesson, written to drop in beside L-X6.**

> **L-X? — The capability test: a duty is owned only when the assignee's
> runtime holds the inputs its evidence requires.** After the cadence
> test, read the duty's evidence and then read the assignee's workflow.
> `grep -oE 'secrets\.[A-Z_]+' .github/workflows/<seat>.yml`. If the

> endpoint, and the credential that reaches it is absent, the duty is not
> owned. It is being reported on from a proxy, which is worse than being
> unreported, because a proxy produces a number. Charters are free and
> crons are free. Credentials live in a file no seat can edit, so a
> capability gap is closed by a workflow change and never by a charter
> edit, and the row stays open until the secret is in the file rather than
> from the moment the change is queued.

**Why it is portable.** Every product HQ bootstraps gets `docs/standards/`
and then writes local guardrails whose evidence is outside its own
repository, because that is where products live. The moment a guardrail
names a database it has an input, and the seat that holds the guardrail is
assigned by a charter while its inputs are assigned by a workflow. Those
two files are edited by different actors at different times, which is the
whole mechanism. Alexandria's own queue page had one seat's version of this
need sitting on it since 2026-09-20, as that seat's problem rather than as
a class.

**One question alexandria cannot answer from here.** Whether the same gap
exists in HQ's own seats and in the other products. It is one command per
repository and it needs the cross-repo read the centralizer already has.
