# Incident register — agent runs and sandboxes

Owner-directed (2026-09-18): a technical record of agents not properly
running, shutting down, or losing work, so failures are learned from
once instead of rediscovered. Append-only, dated, any seat or the chair
may add entries; the ExO reads this file every run (charter step 2) and
turns patterns into charter or workflow fixes.

## 2026-09-17/18 — the founding night's failures

1. **OIDC permission missing.** First cloud run (engineer,
   run 35297972051) failed 3/3 attempts: claude-code-action requires
   `id-token: write`, absent from the workflows. FIXED (commit
   c7e67d5) across all workflows.
2. **Default tool sandbox blocks shipping, run still reports
   success.** The smoke run completed green with 17 permission
   denials: the action's default permission mode refused git pushes
   and PR creation, and the job's conclusion hid it. FIXED: 
   `--permission-mode bypassPermissions` (commit 80721ee), justified
   by the isolated ephemeral runner and repo-scoped token.
3. **Run reports success, ships nothing (end-loaded shipping).** Sales
   first run (35305610562): 59 turns, zero denials, subtype success,
   no branch pushed, no PR, all work lost at sandbox teardown. The PM
   scrum-overhaul run (35301912056) had the same no-ship outcome and
   later flipped to a failure conclusion; its logs were not
   retrievable afterward. PATTERN FIX pending with the ExO: every
   charter mandates draft-PR-first (branch, push, `gh pr create
   --draft` within the first turns, commit as you go), plus a
   workflow tripwire flagging any run that ends with no branch
   pushed. Board card exists.
4. **Turn-cap starvation on visual work.** Frontend first run
   (35305207776) died at `error_max_turns` (150): build plus
   Playwright plus reading screenshots is turn-hungry. FIXED: cap
   raised to 250 and first-run scope narrowed; a future fix is
   scripting the screenshot batch so turns go to judgment, not
   plumbing.
5. **Shared-checkout collisions (pre-cloud and ad-hoc runs).** A local
   desktop PM run operated in the interactive session's checkout and
   switched its branch mid-commit (resolved by moving all runs to
   isolated Actions checkouts, ADR-18). The ad-hoc remote OKR and
   market runs shared one clone and raced on branches; both
   self-repaired and reported honestly. Scheduled Actions runs each
   get a fresh checkout, so this class is closed except for ad-hoc
   remote sessions.
6. **Same-anchor ledger appends guarantee merge conflicts.** PRs #2
   and #3 both inserted at docs/ideas.md's `## Proposals` header;
   the second merge conflicted exactly as the ExO's first run
   predicted. FIXED at charter level: ledger-writing seats must check
   open PRs touching ideas.md and declare merge order (PR #4).
7. **Hidden-prompt secret paste stored an empty value.** NEON_RO_URL
   was set to an empty string via a masked terminal prompt; runs then
   failed with a confusing local-socket psql error. The skill agent
   diagnosed it correctly and refused to fabricate data. FIXED by
   re-entry plus a rule: any run depending on a secret verifies it
   with a cheap probe first and reports the probe's result.
8. **Ambiguous run conclusions.** GitHub's run list briefly showed the
   PM overhaul as success before recording failure, which misled
   monitoring. Lesson: trust a run's shipped artifacts (branch, PR),
   never its conclusion alone.

9. **Premium seats silently ran on the default model.** The routing
   table assigned the top model to engineer, exo, security, skill,
   weekly, and frontend, but no `--model` flag was set and
   claude-code-action defaults to Sonnet, so every premium run on
   2026-09-17/18 actually used Sonnet. Caught by an owner-requested
   routing audit reading modelUsage from real run logs. FIXED:
   `--model opus` set explicitly on all six workflows. Lesson: a
   routing policy is config plus verification; assert the model from
   run logs, never from intention.
