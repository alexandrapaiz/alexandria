# Why this copy exists. docs/standards/pm.md names this tool as the cure for a
# register merge conflict and says in the same breath that it is NOT a merge
# driver: L-A49 measured all three .gitattributes arms and the forge honours
# none, and `union` corrupts entries. So it is run by hand by the seat that is
# resolving the conflict, and until this commit alexandria had no copy of it
# under any name. The handoff that assigned the vendoring is alexandria/exo's
# of 2026-11-09, which found the whole merge debt of that seat to be two runs
# appending to one register tail.
#
# Why HQ head and not the copy Ursa pinned. The pin froze content from
# 2026-10-18 (HQ f29a8e84) and HQ has taken four commits since. One of them,
# 9a12e957, is the `fenced()` guard below: before it the heading pattern was
# tested against every line, so a register entry quoting a shell comment that
# begins with hashes was split at that line and everything after it was
# reattributed to a key taken from inside a code sample. Measured here on
# 2026-11-09 across seven registers: 1,449 lines sit inside fences and 55 of
# them match a one-to-six-hash heading pattern, but NONE matches the `^## `
# or `^### ` depth our registers key on. So the pin would also have been
# correct here today, by luck, which is the same reading HQ recorded for
# Ursa's register before it shipped the fix.
#
# The one edit to the body: the usage line in the docstring names the local
# path rather than the parent's. docs/agents/cross-repo-law.md requires that a
# tool path in a vendored sentence be readable without a filesystem call, and
# the convention it states is that a hyphen in a `tools/` path means the path
# belongs to the parent. A byte-identical copy would have told every reader
# here to run a file that does not exist.

"""Three-way merge of an append-only, date-keyed register, by entry.

    tools/merge_register.py --heading '^### ' BASE OURS THEIRS > MERGED

Why this is not `git merge-file --union`. A union merge is textual and
line-aligned, so when two branches append entries that happen to share a line,
git aligns that line and interleaves the rest. Two seats filing an entry under
the same date and name on the same day produced exactly this:

    ### 2026-10-01 — same name
    - Trigger: mine
    - Trigger: yours different

One heading, two bodies, no conflict marker, and every heading-level check
passes because the corruption is inside the entry. That is a silently wrong
ledger entry, which is worse than the conflict it replaced.

So merge entries, not lines. An entry is a heading line and everything up to
the next heading; its identity is the heading itself (standards/pm.md §4: an
entry is keyed by its date and name). For a date-keyed register the result is
THEIRS in theirs' own order, then the entries only OURS has. Nothing is ever
blended: every entry in the output is byte-for-byte an entry from one of the
inputs.

Theirs' order, not the base's, and the order is not a detail. Both call sites
pass the already-published side as `theirs` (`tools/unjam-ledger.sh` merges the
mainline into a branch, so stage 2 `ours` is the branch and stage 3 `theirs` is
the mainline). Rebuilding the result from the base's order instead cost
something measurable: on PR #130, a branch adding one 13-line entry, the diff
against `main` came to 113 insertions and 107 deletions, and none of those 220
lines was content. The reason is that this ledger is not maintained by
appending. Entries are inserted in date order, so `main` does not equal the
base plus appends, and rebuilding from the base relocates everything `main`
inserted. Worse, it compounds: the relocated order becomes the next merge's
mainline, so the following rebase from a different base moves the same entries
again. Taking theirs' order verbatim ends that. The result's diff against the
published side is exactly the entries this branch adds, at the tail, which is
also where a register's newest entries belong.

A numbered register keeps the base's order instead, and that is a deliberate
exception rather than an oversight. See the paragraph on order below: its tail
is read by the rule that allocates the next number, so the highest number has
to land last, and that cannot be reconciled with following theirs' order when
ours took a lower number than theirs did. A noisier diff is the smaller cost.

It refuses, rather than guessing, when:
  - both sides wrote a different entry under the same heading (an identifier
    collision: the thing to do is rename one, which is a judgment call)
  - both sides changed the same existing entry differently
  - either side deleted an entry the other kept (grooming is not an append)
  - the two sides disagree about the text before the first entry
  - `--identifier` is given and the merge would be what made two entries share
    one identifier (see below)

`--identifier REGEX` makes the register sequence-numbered rather than date-keyed:
an entry carries a short id in its heading (`## ADR-040 — …`, `## Incident 7 — …`)
that other files cite by that id alone. Entry-by-entry merging is still the
right mechanism there, because the entries themselves are appends that disagree
about nothing. The one thing a numbered register adds is that the number is
allocated from a counter in the file, so two branches that both read the same
tail take the same number, and keeping both appends would publish two entries
answering to one name (L-A18, whose repair is to renumber the newer entry and
record the old number in it, never to merge the collision quietly).

The test is whether *this merge* is what created the sharing, not whether the
result contains a duplicate at all: an id's count in the output may not exceed
its count on both sides. A duplicate already present on both sides predates the
merge and is some other branch's repair to make. One the merge would introduce
is refused, named, and left to a human, because choosing the replacement number
is an allocation and the citations of the old one have to move with it.

Order matters here in a way it does not for a date-keyed register, and getting
it wrong manufactures the next collision rather than today's. The rule that
allocates these numbers is "read the register's own tail and take the next free
one". Appending each side's entries in side order put ADR-040 above ADR-039 on
a real branch of this repository, so the file's last entry was 039 and the next
author reading the tail would have taken 040 a second time. So the entries
*this merge adds* are ordered by their identifier, which leaves the highest
number last whenever it was last on both sides. Base entries keep the base's
order untouched, because the base's order is not this merge's to normalise, and
an added entry carrying no identifier sorts after the numbered ones, which is
where an appendix belongs. The post-condition is checked, not assumed.

`--key REGEX` makes an entry's identity part of its heading line rather than
the whole of it, which is what a markdown table needs. A row carries its
content on the line that carries its name, so keyed by the line, a row one side
edited is a delete plus an add and the merge sees a disagreement where there is
none; keyed by its first cell it is an edit, which three-way merging already
knows how to do. Everything else is unchanged: the identity is still what two
sides may not both invent differently, and the bytes emitted are still one
side's.

`--section REGEX` says the register is one section of a document rather than
the whole file, and `--section-end` (default `^## `) says where it ends. The
growth ledger of `docs/architecture/agentic-system.md` is the case this was
built for: decision 056 made that file an every-run register on 2026-10-17, and
by 2026-10-18 four of the six unmergeable `engineer/` branches conflicted in
that one section and nowhere else in the file. The file could not simply be
declared a register, because the rest of it is prose a reader checks against
the host, and keeping both sides of a prose disagreement is how a drawing stops
being true. So the section is merged entry by entry and the rest is merged by
`git merge-file` -- git's own answer, so the only difference this tool makes to
a file is inside the section it was pointed at -- and a real conflict out there
is refused by name rather than resolved.

Exit 0 and the merged register on stdout, or exit 1 and the reason on stderr.

    hashes and a space was **split at that line**, and everything after it was
